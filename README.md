# Investigate Hotel Business using Data Visualization

## Content
The dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

The dataset has been altered and adapted for education purposes by Rakamin Academy team.

I downloaded and worked on the dataset on September 2022 as a part of my mini project tasks as a Data Science student in Rakamin Academy.
